Go to source repository in a browser
Create a fork of the original repository, which creates a copy in own GitHub in a repository of the same name
Lets say original repo was: https://github.com/SomeGreatPerson/TheirGreatProject
You will have a new repo call 'TheirGreatProject'

Locally:
git clone https://github.com/ThirdRepublic/TheirGreatProject greatProject
  # get a local copy of the forked repository from own GitHub
  # doesn't matter what you call your local repo
git branch issueXYZ
  # always create a branch for changes; best practice to name it for thing you're going to submit back
git checkout issueXYZ
  # switch to new branch
  # make changes
git add .
  # add the changes
git commit -m "Made some crazy changes"
  # commit the changes locally
  # use interactive mode to tidy up your commits
git push --set-upstream origin issueXYZ
  # first time need 'set-upstream...' because branch doesn't exist on remote, thereafter just 'git push'

To refresh with changes in original repository to make sure your changes are going to work 
  with new changes that have come in since you began developing your contribution 
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SomeGreatPerson/TheirGreatProject
  # create a 'variable' pointing to the place the original fork was made from
git fetch upstream
  # fetch the changes
  # probably you could get away with 'git fetch upstream master' - since you are only interested in changes to master
git checkout master
  # make sure current local branch is repository
git merge upstream/master
  # merge in the changes that have been fetched from upstream
  # now local master is up to date with orginal master - this should have just fast-forwarded
  # for this reason don't every make local changes to the master branch
  # keep the master clean so it will always update to the latest version of the original project

git checkout issueXYZ
  # switch to the branch that you've been making changes to
git rebase
  # reapply all these changes to the updated copy of master
  # this ensures your changes will work on the most up to date copy of the original master

git push
  # update your GitHub copy of the repository

Online do a pull request on your change branch to the original master
